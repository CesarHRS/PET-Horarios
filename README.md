# Intalation Guide:

First, you have to install python
>> sudo apt install python

Then install the google API library
>> pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

After that, you will need to download the client_secret.json. You can do that by opening google cloud console, then going to API and services, then credentials and downloading the client OAuth key. 

Then, put the file you downloaded in the same folder as the code, rename it to "client_secret.json" and it's done.
